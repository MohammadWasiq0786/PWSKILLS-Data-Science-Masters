    "# 1. Restful Services\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful services, also known as RESTful APIs, are web services that follow the REST architectural style REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is a set of principles for building web services that use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as the communication protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful services are based on the following principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Client-Server Architecture\n",
    "The client and server are separated, allowing them to evolve independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Stateless\n",
    "Each request sent to the server contains all the information needed to complete the request. The server does not maintain any client context between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Cacheable\n",
    "Responses from the server can be cached to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Uniform Interface\n",
    "RESTful services use a uniform interface consisting of resources, HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). and hypermedia links.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Layered System\n",
    "RESTful services can be composed of multiple layers, allowing for scalability, flexibility, and security."
