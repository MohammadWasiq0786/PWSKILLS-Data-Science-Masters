    "**Q1 :** What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :** **Lasso Regression** is a type of linear regression technique that is commonly used in machine learning and statistics to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, the goal is to identify a subset of independent variables that are most relevant to the dependent variable, while also minimizing the impact of irrelevant or redundant variables. This is achieved by adding a penalty term to the regression equation that penalizes the coefficients of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compared to other regression techniques** like Ridge Regression and Ordinary Least Squares Regression, Lasso Regression has the following unique features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature selection:** Lasso Regression can perform automatic feature selection, which means it can identify the most relevant independent variables and exclude irrelevant or redundant ones from the model. This is particularly useful when dealing with datasets with many independent variables, as it can help reduce overfitting and improve model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shrinking coefficients:** In addition to selecting features, Lasso Regression can also shrink the coefficients of the remaining independent variables towards zero. This helps to prevent overfitting and can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sparsity:** Lasso Regression produces sparse models, which means that the final model will typically include only a subset of the original independent variables. This can make the model easier to interpret and can help reduce the computational complexity of the model."

    "\n",
    "**Ans :** The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically identify and select the most relevant independent variables while excluding irrelevant or redundant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with datasets that contain many independent variables, it can be difficult to determine which variables are most important for predicting the dependent variable. Including irrelevant or redundant variables in the model can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression addresses this problem by adding a penalty term to the regression equation that encourages small or zero coefficients for some of the independent variables. This penalty term causes the coefficients of some of the variables to shrink towards zero, effectively eliminating those variables from the model. "

    "**Q3 :** How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :** When interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model, it is important to take into account both the magnitude and the sign of the coefficients, as well as the variables that have been included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a coefficient is positive, it means that as the corresponding independent variable increases, the dependent variable is also expected to increase, holding all other variables constant. If a coefficient is negative, it means that as the corresponding independent variable increases, the dependent variable is expected to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if some coefficients are exactly equal to zero, it means that the corresponding independent variables have been excluded from the model and do not have any impact on the dependent variable. The variables that remain in the model with non-zero coefficients are assumed to be the most important variables for predicting the dependent variable, given the other variables in the model."

    "**Q4 :** What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :** Lasso Regression has one main tuning parameter, which is the regularization parameter, also known as the lambda parameter. This parameter controls the strength of the penalty term added to the regression equation, which determines the degree of shrinkage of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the value of the lambda parameter, the more the coefficients will be shrunk towards zero, and the more features will be eliminated from the model. Conversely, a lower value of the lambda parameter will result in less shrinkage of the coefficients and more features being included in the model."

    "**Q5 :** Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :** It is possible to use Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems by transforming the independent variables into a non-linear form before fitting the model. This is known as non-linear feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-linear feature engineering involves transforming the original independent variables using mathematical functions such as logarithmic, exponential, polynomial, or trigonometric functions. This allows the model to capture non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "After transforming the independent variables, Lasso Regression can be applied as usual to perform feature selection and regularization. However, it is important to note that the transformed features may introduce new collinearity issues, and it may be necessary to apply additional feature selection techniques such as PCA or VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) to remove any redundant or correlated features."

Ridge Regression adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients, while Lasso Regression adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients."

    "\n",
    "**Ans :** Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features to some extent, but it may not completely resolve the issue. Multicollinearity occurs when there is a high degree of correlation between two or more independent variables, which can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression can help reduce the impact of multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients of correlated variables towards zero, which effectively selects one variable from the correlated set and eliminates the others. However, this does not completely remove the multicollinearity issue, as the selected variable may still be highly correlated with other variables that were not selected."

    "\n",
    "- **Cross-validation:** Cross-validation is a popular method for selecting the optimal value of lambda. The data is divided into k-folds, and the model is trained on k-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated for different values of lambda, and the value of lambda that gives the best cross-validation score is chosen as the optimal value.\n",

    "- **Information criteria:** The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are popular methods for selecting the optimal value of lambda. These criteria penalize the model complexity, and the optimal value of lambda is chosen as the value that gives the lowest AIC or BIC score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grid search:** A grid search is a brute force approach to select the optimal value of lambda. A range of values for lambda is defined, and the model is trained for each value of lambda. The value of lambda that gives the best performance on the validation set is chosen as the optimal value."
