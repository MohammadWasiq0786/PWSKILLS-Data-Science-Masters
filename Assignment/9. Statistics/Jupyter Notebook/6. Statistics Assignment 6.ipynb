    "**Q1 :** What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :** A **t-test** and a **z-test** are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. However, there are some differences between the two tests, primarily related to the assumptions made about the population and the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **z-test** assumes that the sample comes from a normally distributed population, and the population standard deviation is known. This test is used when the sample size is large (typically, n > 30) and the population variance is known or can be assumed to be known. For example, if a company wants to test if the mean height of their employees is different from the national average, and they know the standard deviation of the population height, they can use a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a **t-test** assumes that the sample comes from a normally distributed population, and the population standard deviation is unknown. This test is used when the sample size is small (typically, n < 30) or when the population variance is unknown. For example, if a researcher wants to test if a new drug has a different effect than a placebo, they can use a t-test to compare the mean scores of two groups of participants.\n",

    "**Q2 :** Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :** In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis (H0) is a statement about a population parameter that is assumed to be true unless there is sufficient evidence to reject it in favor of an alternative hypothesis (Ha). The alternative hypothesis is the statement that the researcher is trying to support.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-tailed tests and two-tailed tests are types of hypothesis tests that differ in the directionality of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-tailed test is a hypothesis test in which the alternative hypothesis specifies the direction of the effect or difference being tested. That is, the researcher is interested in whether the population parameter is either greater than or less than a certain value, but not both. Therefore, the rejection region for the null hypothesis is only on one side of the distribution. A one-tailed test is often used when the researcher has a specific directional hypothesis or when there is a theoretical or practical reason to expect an effect in a specific direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a one-tailed test might be used to test the hypothesis that a new medication will decrease the amount of time it takes for patients to fall asleep. The alternative hypothesis would be that the medication decreases the amount of time it takes for patients to fall asleep, and the null hypothesis would be that the medication has no effect on the amount of time it takes for patients to fall asleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a two-tailed test is a hypothesis test in which the alternative hypothesis does not specify the direction of the effect or difference being tested. That is, the researcher is interested in whether the population parameter is different from a certain value in any direction. Therefore, the rejection region for the null hypothesis is split between both sides of the distribution. A two-tailed test is often used when the researcher has no specific directional hypothesis or when there is no theoretical or practical reason to expect an effect in a specific direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a two-tailed test might be used to test the hypothesis that the mean weight of male and female newborns is the same. The alternative hypothesis would be that the mean weight of male and female newborns is different, and the null hypothesis would be that the mean weight of male and female newborns is equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, one-tailed tests and two-tailed tests differ in the directionality of the alternative hypothesis, and the choice between the two depends on the research question and the directional nature of the hypothesis."

    "**Q3 :** Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for each type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans :**In hypothesis testing, Type I and Type II errors are two types of errors that can occur when testing a hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I error is the error that occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. In other words, it is the false positive error, where we reject the null hypothesis even though it is correct. The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by alpha (α) and is often set at 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a researcher is testing the effectiveness of a new medication on a disease. The null hypothesis is that the medication has no effect on the disease, and the alternative hypothesis is that the medication has an effect. If the researcher rejects the null hypothesis and concludes that the medication is effective, but in reality, it is not, then a Type I error has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type II error is the error that occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. In other words, it is the false negative error, where we fail to reject the null hypothesis even though it is incorrect. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by beta (β).\n",

The null hypothesis is that the medication has no effect on the disease, and the alternative hypothesis is that the medication has an effect. If the researcher fails to reject the null hypothesis and concludes that the medication is not effective, but in reality, it is effective, then a Type II error has occurred.\n",

    "Type I error: A car alarm system is designed to go off if an intruder tries to break in. However, if the alarm goes off when no one is trying to break in, it is a false positive, which is a Type I error.\n",

    "**Ans :** Bayes's theorem is a mathematical formula used to calculate the conditional probability of an event based on prior knowledge of related events. It is named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician, and philosopher.\n",

    "P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",

    "**Ans :** A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter with a certain degree of confidence. In other words, it is a range of values around a sample statistic that is likely to contain the true population parameter value with a certain level of certainty or probability.\n",

The test has a false positive rate of 5%, meaning that 5% of the time, a healthy person will test positive for the disease.

    "**Ans :** The margin of error in a confidence interval is the range of values around the sample estimate that we are confident contains the true population value. It represents the amount of uncertainty in our estimate due to sampling error.\n",

    "The margin of error is affected by several factors, including the level of confidence desired, the sample size, and the variability of the data. In general, a larger sample size results in a smaller margin of error, all else being equal.

    "Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",

    "The level of significance is 0.10 or 90% confidence level. Since the sample size is small (n < 30), we will use a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Calculate the test statistic.\n",

    "t = (x̄1 - x̄2) / (s/√n)\n",
    "\n",
    "where x̄1 is the sample mean reaction time for the caffeine group, x̄2 is the sample mean reaction time for the non-caffeine group, s is the pooled standard deviation, and n is the sample size for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the pooled standard deviation, we use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "s = √[(s1^2 + s2^2) / 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "where s1 and s2 are the sample standard deviations for the caffeine and non-caffeine groups, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
